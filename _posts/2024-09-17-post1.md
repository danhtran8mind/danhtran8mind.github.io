## Your First Python Program: Saying "Hello World" ðŸŒŽ

Ready to dive into the world of Python programming? Let's start with the most iconic introductory program â€“ printing "Hello World" to the console. It's a simple yet satisfying way to begin your coding journey.

**Here's the code:**

```python
print("Hello World")
```

**Let's break it down:**

* **`print()`:** This is a built-in Python function. Its job is to display whatever is inside the parentheses on your screen.
* **"Hello World"**: This is the text you want to display. The text needs to be enclosed in quotation marks (single or double) to tell Python it's a string literal (a piece of text).

**How to Run the Code:**

1. **Save your code:** Open a text editor (like Notepad, Sublime Text, or VS Code) and paste the code. Save the file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `hello.py`).
2. **Open your terminal/command prompt:** Navigate to the directory where you saved your file. 
3. **Run the code:** Type `python hello.py` (replace `hello.py` with your file name) and press Enter.

**You did it!** You should now see "Hello World" displayed in your terminal.  ðŸŽ‰

This might seem basic, but it introduces fundamental programming concepts like:

* **Syntax:** Python's specific rules for writing code.
* **Functions:** Blocks of reusable code that perform tasks.
* **Data Types:**  "Hello World" is a string of characters.

This is just the beginning.  Stay tuned for more Python adventures! ðŸš€
